Pin 3 on the 3.3 volt power regulator needs to be connected to pin 1 on the power regulator (instead of the current pin 3 -> pin 5 connection).  This really should have been caught in the last round of testing, but it is possible that another error masked it (3.3v was recorded in the last tests). Check.

Review of the STM32F072 eval board (schematics apparently available on site) revealed that the USB ID pin on the eval board is connected to ground with a 100 KOhm resistor.  This may be why the USB interface is not working.-> nope, soldered wrong wire.  Fix USB-minus to connect to PA11.  Check.

Also, testing of my voltage protection circuit reveals that it is not doing a darn thing (I blame the back-EMF protection diodes).  For further designs, that mechanism should probably be reworked.

Tx and Rx on USART are flipped, check other USART pins and update local input/output settings on MCU to catch this sort of error in the future.  Oddly, it looks like the original settings SHOULD be right, but are not. Check.

Make pad for securing DF13 connectors bigger.  It is hard to get the cables out and I have already damaged one pad.

Need to add resistor to limit current draw on LED (look at reccomended current/voltage drop and plan accordingly). Looks like 100 ohms.

Need to add big capacitor on 5V rail (220 uf?).  SMD electrolytic looks like a good option.  This may need to be higher when many different rangers are firing at once, but it seems like a good starting value.  Make sure the lifetime is rated long enough (higher temp tolerance tends to lead to higher life, as life rating is at max rated temp). Check.

Also need to update one of the capacitors since I ended up going with a different model since the other was not available on Mouser.  Leaving for now, need to look at BOM.  It is C0402X5R1A103M020BC that needs to be updated/replaced.
